# blackstone.nvim

Let me guess, you "need" more.

This is a many-shades-of-dark theme for Neovim. It's essentially an experiment
because I dislike making colourful themes (can never decide on how to theme
things).

It is similar but also different when it comes to other vim monochromatic
themes. I try to utilize more gradient in the colours to highlight
depth/importance.

As of this commit the colour pallet is as follows:

```lua
-- base colours
colours.black = "#000000"
colours.gray1 = "#111111"
colours.gray2 = "#222222"
colours.gray3 = "#333333"
colours.gray4 = "#444444"
colours.gray5 = "#555555"
colours.gray6 = "#666666"
colours.gray7 = "#777777"
colours.gray8 = "#888888"
colours.gray9 = "#999999"
colours.white = "#eeeeee"
colours.red = "#EC5959"
colours.builtin = "#32565D"
```

You can see the full file in [lua/colours.lua](lua/colours.lua).
